%description
Functions for a classification method based on receiver operating
characteristics (ROC). Briefly, features are selected according to their
ranked AUC value in the training set. The selected features are merged by
the mean value to form a metagene. The samples are ranked by their
metagene value and the metagene threshold that has the highest accuracy in
splitting the training samples is determined. A new sample is classified
by its metagene value relative to the threshold. In the first place, the
package is aimed at two class problems in gene expression data, but might
also apply to other problems.
