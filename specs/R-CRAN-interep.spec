%description
Extensive penalized variable selection methods have been developed in the
past two decades for analyzing high dimensional omics data, such as gene
expressions, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), copy number
variations (CNVs) and others. However, lipidomics data have been rarely
investigated by using high dimensional variable selection methods. This
package incorporates our recently developed penalization procedures to
conduct interaction analysis for high dimensional lipidomics data with
repeated measurements. The core module of this package is developed in
C++. The development of this software package and the associated
statistical methods have been partially supported by an Innovative
Research Award from Johnson Cancer Research Center, Kansas State
University.
