%description
Execute BayesianFROC::fit_GUI_Shiny() (or fit_GUI_Shiny_MRMC()) for a
graphical user interface via Shiny. The free-response receiver operating
characteristic (FROC) method is a generalization of receiver operating
characteristic (ROC) analysis. However, Chakraborty's classical model is
non-generative in the sense that it cannot synthesize data. This package
aims to modify his models to be generative using a Bayesian approach, and
to verify that our models fit practical datasets. We also develop a
Bayesian model for comparing modalities. Chakraborty [1] defined a
free-response receiver operating characteristic (FROC) model based on
maximum likelihood (ML). However, his model is non-generative in the sense
that it cannot generate FROC datasets. In signal detection theory, the
number of true positives never exceeds the number of targets. However,
this is not explained by any existing model. Thus, in this package, the
author contributes to FROC theory by refining Chakrabortyâ€™s model to
obtain models that are generative. This modification allows us to use FROC
analysis in a general statistical scheme, and as a benefit, our generative
model can be applied to calculations of posterior predictive p values that
require generation of synthetic datasets from fitted models. Furthermore,
this package presents new models for comparison of modalities. Modality
comparison is a common problem in radiology, and has been studied
extensively. However, in many medical studies, such problems are addressed
with non-Bayesian methods such as ANOVA. As a supplementary topic, this
work presents a Bayesian model that includes individual differences. With
this model, we can account for differences between individual readers when
comparing modalities, using Bayesian rather than ML-methods. The author
found the existing FROC model in [1] to be non-generative for calculation
of posterior predictive p values. Replacing the ML-based method with a
Bayesian approach differs from standard practice but provides insight into
the problems of existing methods. Please execute the following R scripts
from the R (R studio) console, demo(demo_MRMC, package = "BayesianFROC");
demo(demo_srsc, package = "BayesianFROC"); demo(demo_stan, package =
"BayesianFROC"); demo(demo_drawcurves_srsc, package = "BayesianFROC");
