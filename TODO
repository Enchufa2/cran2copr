# SPEC generation

- RGtk2 requires pango < 1.44 at the moment, so it doesn't compile in rawhide
- Rmpi requires libmpi.so.40()(ARCH), it should be libmpi.so.40()(ARCH)(openmpi)
- it would be nice to provide -openmpi, -mpich, etc., packages, as described in
  the packaging guidelines
- some packages do not generate debuginfo (now, debug package disabled)
  - StanHeaders generates a .a, and dependencies are statically linked against it
  - others are marked as NeedsCompilation, but they don't, e.g., reshape
- there are old packages that need compilation, but they don't have that in the
  DESCRIPTION file, e.g., proj4 (now, hardcoded as old_nc)
- some packages generate installed files or directories on the fly during the
  installation, e.g., stringi, but these are hard to discover automatically
  without actually installing the package
- in general, need a better way to inject exceptions
- translate LICENSEs to Fedora format
- detect which packages are in the main repos and depend on them, instead of
  rebuilding everything in Copr

- integration with r-hub/sysreqsdb -> https://sysreqs.r-hub.io/

# Copr operation

- ability to fetch the status of packages per chroot
- ability to rebuild packages in a particular chroot
- ability to automatically relaunch builds that failed and do not require manual
  inspection (i.e., when the failure is due to a server error, because the
  builder wasn't able to fetch the repo metadata or some packages; aparently,
  this is quite common))

# System integration

- implement system service that exports a method to request package installation
- hook into install.packages and talk to the service via dbus
- install non-available packages directly from CRAN
